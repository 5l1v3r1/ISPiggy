Decentralized DNS fuzzer to mitigate ISP Snooping

ISP's can track your DNS requests. <br>
The project goal is to disguise your web surfing habit from your ISP or DNS provider by injecting random DNS domain requests for the upstream DNS server to resolve.<br>
<h2>What does this accomplish?</h2>

* Their DNS logs will have erroneous DNS requests
* With enough fuzzy requests, they will have a lot of unreliable info to data mine
